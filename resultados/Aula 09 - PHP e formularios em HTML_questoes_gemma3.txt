Okay, the user wants me to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided JSON content. Let me check the JSON they gave. Wait, the JSON is just ["nome"], which seems like a single string. That's not enough information to create meaningful questions. Maybe there's a mistake in the JSON? The user mentioned it's the content of a lesson, but it's only the name "nome". 

Hmm, perhaps the JSON was supposed to have more data but got truncated. Since there's no actual content, I can't generate questions based on the lesson material. I should inform the user that the provided JSON doesn't have sufficient information. But the user might have intended to include more data. Alternatively, maybe "nome" is part of a larger structure that's missing. 

In any case, without proper content, generating questions isn't possible. I'll need to point out that the JSON is incomplete and ask for the correct data. But since the user might have made an error, I should also offer to help once they provide the right information.

O conteúdo da aula fornecido está incompleto ou inválido (apenas `["nome"]`). Para gerar questões educacionais, é necessário que o JSON contenha informações relevantes sobre o tema da aula, como conceitos, definições, exemplos ou conteúdos abordados. Por favor, forneça o conteúdo da aula em formato válido (com dados específicos) para que eu possa criar as questões.
