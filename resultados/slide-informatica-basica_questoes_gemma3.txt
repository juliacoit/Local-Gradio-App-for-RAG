Okay, the user wants me to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the lesson content provided in JSON. But wait, the JSON content is empty. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the input. The user mentioned the lesson content is in JSON, but the example shows an empty string. I need to check if there's any actual content there. Since it's empty, I can't generate questions based on it. 

Wait, maybe the user intended to include the JSON but forgot. In that case, I should inform them that the content is missing. Alternatively, perhaps the JSON was supposed to be part of the message but didn't come through. Either way, without the actual lesson content, I can't create the questions. 

I should respond by letting the user know that the JSON content is missing and ask them to provide it so I can proceed. That way, they can correct the input and give me the necessary information to generate the questions as requested.
