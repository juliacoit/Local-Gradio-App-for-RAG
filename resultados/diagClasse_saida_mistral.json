    "Show examples of unary, binary, ternary associations in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  4.2. Aggregation\n      * Discuss aggregations as a strong form of association where one object contains a reference to another object but does not own it completely.\n      * Define the [0..1] or [*] multiplicity for both ends, depending on the type of aggregation.\n      * Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  4.3. Composition\n      * Describe compositions as a stronger form of aggregation where one object owns another object's existence entirely, and it will be destroyed when its owner is destroyed.\n      * Define the multiplicity rules for both ends ([1..1] for the owner, [0..1] or [*] for the part).\n      * Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  4.4. Generalization / Specialization\n      * Explain how generalization allows multiple classes to share common attributes and behavior while emphasizing their differences through subclasses.\n      * Define the \"is-a\" relationship between a superclass and its subclasses.\n      * Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  4.5. Realization\n      * Discuss how realization represents the relationship between an interface or abstract class and its implementation class, which must provide the required functionality.\n      * Define the \"implements\" relationship between interfaces/abstract classes and their concrete implementations.\n      * Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  4.6. Dependency\n      * Describe dependency as a relationship indicating that one class depends on another for some of its functionality or data.\n      * Define the \"uses\" relationship between dependent and dependent classes.\n      * Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n\n5. Stereotypes, Restrictions, and Classifiers\n  5.1. Stereotypes\n      * Explain how stereotypes are user-defined symbols applied to classes or associations to provide additional information about them.\n      * Show examples of common stereotypes like <<entity>>, <<boundary>>, and <<control>> in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  5.2. Restrictions\n      * Define restrictions as constraints applied to attributes, methods, or associations within a class diagram.\n      * Discuss the different types of restrictions like",
    "unique,",
    "multiplicity,\" and \"sequence.",
    "Show examples in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n  5.3. Classifiers\n      * Explain how classifiers represent any type of model element, not just classes, including interfaces, protocols, use cases, components, etc.\n      * Discuss the importance of using appropriate classifiers to create a clear, concise design for your system.\n\n6. Project Navigation\n* Introduce the concept of project navigation and its use in UML diagrams.\n* Show examples of using stereotypes like <<server page>>, <<client page>>, and <<form>> to represent different parts of a web application's user interface in Java classes and their corresponding class diagrams.\n\n7. Conclusion\n* Summarize the importance of using UML diagrams in software development.\n* Encourage readers to practice creating their own class diagrams for real-world projects, using the concepts presented in this guide.\n* Provide suggestions on where to find additional resources for learning more about UML and object-oriented design."
