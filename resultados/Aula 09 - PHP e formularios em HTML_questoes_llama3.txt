Okay, the user wants me to generate 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided lesson content in JSON format. But wait, the JSON content is empty. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the user's message. They mentioned the lesson content is in JSON, but the example shows an empty string. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user provided a JSON structure but it's empty. So there's no actual content to base the questions on. That's a problem. Without the lesson material, I can't create relevant questions. Maybe the user intended to include the JSON content but forgot. 

I should inform them that the JSON content is missing, making it impossible to generate the questions. I need to ask for the actual lesson content so I can proceed. Let me draft a response pointing out the issue and requesting the necessary information.

O conteúdo da aula em JSON está vazio ou não foi fornecido corretamente, o que impossibilita a criação de questões educacionais. Por favor, forneça o conteúdo da aula em formato JSON válido para que eu possa gerar as questões com base nele.
